WXAdvisory
==========

Get weather information (TAFOR) from certain airports and send warning email when conditions are out of limits.

WXAdvisory gets the current TAFOR from a certain airport (obtained from NOAA) and parses the text. If weather conditions are found to be beyond a specified threshold, it sends an email (currently via Mailgun) to warn about it.
